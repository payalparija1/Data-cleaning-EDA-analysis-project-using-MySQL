# Data-cleaning-project-using-MySQL
Cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis of the corporate layoff 2022 data using MySQL 
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing raw data using MySQL to ensure it is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. The dataset used contains information regarding corporate layoffs during 2022. It has fields like Company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, date, stage, country, and funds_raised_millions which included missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and irrelevant entries.
I have used advanced SQL queries using Window Functions, CTE, Joins, etc.
The primary goal of the project was to perform a data cleaning process and EDA analysis using SQL queries, thereby enhancing data quality and ensuring reliable downstream analytics.
